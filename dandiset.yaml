description: 'Hippocampal theta oscillations coordinate neuronal firing to support
  memory and spatial navigation. The medial septum (MS) is critical in theta generation
  by two possible mechanisms: either a unitary “pacemaker” timing signal is imposed
  on the hippocampal system, or it may assist in organizing target subcircuits within
  the phase space of theta oscillations. We used temperature manipulation of the MS
  to test these models. Cooling of the MS reduced both theta frequency and power and
  was associated with an enhanced incidence of errors in a spatial navigation task,
  but it did not affect spatial correlates of neurons. MS cooling decreased theta
  frequency oscillations of place cells and reduced distance-time compression but
  preserved distance-phase compression of place field sequences within the theta cycle.
  Thus, the septum is critical for sustaining precise theta phase coordination of
  cell assemblies in the hippocampal system, a mechanism needed for spatial memory.'
